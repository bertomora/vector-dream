## Glitch NFT Art Generator - Major Updates

### Speed Changes
- Made animation 5x faster (time multiplier 0.001 → 0.005) for more seizure-like glitch effect
- Later slowed down the 3D primitives to be centered and slowly rotating

### Resolution
- Changed canvas from 1200x1200 to 1000x1000

### Removed Elements
- Removed blob/cluster system (user didn't like the blobby floating objects)
- Removed wireframe 3D primitives (cubes, pyramids, octahedrons) - looked out of place
- Removed diagonal pixel streaks (X-shaped crosses didn't fit)
- Removed geometric shapes and isometric cubes sections

### Added/Modified Elements
- Replaced blob clusters with "glitch distortion zones" - circular areas with scan distortion, pixel scatter, or color bleed
- Made rectangular glitch outlines more random (varied sizes, positions, rotations, movement directions)
- Made sharp data blocks much more random (varied sizes from tiny to huge, random colors from all 4 palette colors, random positions, rotations, effects)

### Color Changes
- Added 50% chance of saturation boost (+0.15) for more vibrant colors
- Base saturation range increased (0.6-1.0, up to 1.15 with boost)

### Created 6 Variant Files for User to Compare
All saved in glitch-nft/ folder:

1. **variant-a.html** - Heavy interlaced scanlines with color bleed, interference flashes, horizontal banding
2. **variant-b.html** - Extreme RGB channel separation with color halos, diagonal streaks
3. **variant-c.html** - LED matrix/dot grid with RGB subpixel triads, phosphor glow
4. **variant-d.html** - Cyber HUD overlay (corner brackets, crosshair, scanning line, grid, edge ticks)
5. **variant-e.html** - VHS tape damage (tracking errors, noise bands, screen roll, head switching)
6. **variant-f.html** - Databend/vertical melt (pixel stretching, corruption bands, drip lines)

### Technical Notes
- WebGL doesn't allow computed array indices - had to use loop variables directly
- Nested if statements in shaders can cause issues - use step() and mix() instead
- Server: `npx serve -l 3000` in glitch-nft folder

### User Preferences Noted
- Doesn't like geometric wireframe shapes (look out of place)
- Wants elements to be very random (sizes, positions, colors, directions)
- Likes the glitchy pixel aesthetic
- Interested in unifying elements that tie compositions together
- Wants variants to be VERY different from each other, not subtle
