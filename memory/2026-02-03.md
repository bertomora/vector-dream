# 2026-02-03 - Vector Dream Generator Updates

## What We Did Today

### Visual Refinements
- **Removed data blocks & rectangular glitch effects** — those yellow/green rectangles that were cluttering the output
- **Reduced pixelation by 20%** — cleaner, less chunky feel
- **Capped brightness at 92%** — no more blown-out whites
- **Narrowed brightness range to 0.7-1.0** — elegant, never overblown

### Uniqueness Boost
- **Expanded to 32 color palettes** (was 16) — including luxury tones (bronze, gold, rose gold, royal purple)
- **Wider color variation** — each color shifts independently up to ±120°
- **Higher mutation chances** — more variation between pieces

### Premium Gallery Aesthetics
- **Metallic shimmer** — subtle gold highlight on bright areas
- **Soft bloom** — luminous glow on highlights
- **Film lift** — slight light in shadows (high-end film stock feel)
- **Organic grain** — refined film-like grain instead of digital noise
- **Gallery vignette** — softer, elegant falloff that frames the art
- **Inner glow** — subtle light from center
- **12-bit color feel** — smoother gradients

### Brutalist Minimal Vibes
- Updated minimal & void styles to be darker, starker
- Reduced invert mutation (was causing bright outputs)

### Clean Variant System (6 Variants A-F)
Each variant is now isolated — no cross-contamination of effects:

| Variant | Style | Character |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **A** | Synthwave | Spires, grid, horizon glow |
| **B** | Databend | Drips, aurora, pixel sort |
| **C** | Corrupt | Chromatic, glitch, scatter |
| **D** | Neon | Edge glow, streaks, density |
| **E** | Isometric | Cubes, RGB split, grid |
| **F** | Void | Dark, noise warp, atmospheric |

- Consecutive generations always pick a different variant
- Style-specific mutations only enhance the current variant
